## of-have-bot

This is a bot for Reddit that searches through comments where a user has typed "***should of***", "***would of***" or "***could of***" and notifies them with the correct form ("***should have***", "***would have***", "***could have***")

The PRAW library (7.7.1) is used in this project to send requests to reddit.com
