👋 Hi there! I couldn’t help but notice you wrote "should of," "would of," or "could of." While it’s a common mistake, the correct phrase is actually "should have," "would have," or "could have." 😊... Think of it like this: "should’ve," "would’ve," and "could’ve" sound similar to "should of," "would of," and "could of," but the grammar police (and your English teacher) would prefer the former. 🚓✍️...Carry on with your excellent commenting! 🚀
