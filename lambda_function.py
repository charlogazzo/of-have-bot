While it‚Äôs a common mistake, the correct phrase is actually "should have," "would have," or "could have." üòä... Think of it like this: "should‚Äôve," "would‚Äôve," and "could‚Äôve" sound similar to "should of," "would of," and "could of," but the grammar police (and your English teacher) would prefer the former. üöì‚úçÔ∏è...Carry on with your excellent commenting! üöÄ'
